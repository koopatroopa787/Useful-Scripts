## Requirements

Most scripts require Python 3.6+ and various libraries listed in requirements.txt

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/useful-scripts.git
cd useful-scripts
```

2. Install required Python packages:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

Each script can be run independently. Before running, make sure to:
1. Check script-specific requirements
2. Update any configuration variables (API keys, paths, etc.)
3. Install required dependencies

Example:
```bash
python cpu.py
python sorter.py
```

## Important Notes

- Some scripts require API keys (weather.py, reddit.py)
- Update hardcoded paths before running file management scripts
- Configure email credentials for scripts that send emails
- Review security-related scripts before use in production
